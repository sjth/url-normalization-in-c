* url-normalization-in-c, C library to [[http://http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL_normalization][normalize URL]]
There is only one public function clean_url(). You only need link with the files "cleanurl.h" and "cleanurl.c".

I wrote them in purce C (but test program in writte in C++).

Nothing fancy in code. Just simple pointer manipulation. This is a task assigned by an interviewer.

The code in this project is dedicated to [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Domain][public domain]].

* How to build the code.
GNU Makefile are already created.

"premake4.lua" for [[http://industriousone.com/premake][premake]] is also provided. You can use it to produce project files of other platforms.
